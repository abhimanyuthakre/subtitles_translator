### How to use?

[(Back to top)](#list-of-contents)

Make sure that subtitles.py file is in the same directory as of the file you want to translate. 
* If you want to make multiple translations, use spaces between different languages.
  For example, if you want to translate to French and German, then use "fr de" as your input.
* If you want to make translations for all languages, use "all" keyword.
* Suggestion: Make a seperate folder for doing this.
* If you are using the free version, use "pip install googletrans" to add the library to your machine.
* If you are using the Cloud Platform, you need to set the path in your machine to the JSON file. You can get more information
  at https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/libraries.
